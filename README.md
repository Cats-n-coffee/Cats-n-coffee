### Hi there, I'm Lucie ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working on challenging projects by collaborating or working on my own. I have a weird obsession with user interfaces and all things visual. Sprinkle a little logic and I'm strangely attracted (rabbit holes warning).<br>
I currently work as a Frontend Developer and solve cool problems that help people, making the world more open every day. 
<br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a simple desktop UI for Dall-E using Electron. I poke around various Desktop app tools to learn how they work and play with other languages.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
- Electron, VueJs and Browser Extensions 
- Browser rendering and browser engines by reading and watching various Chromium and Blink resources
- Devops and random backend things

<br>

âš¡ Fun fact: As a former Fitness/ Personal Trainer I spent years in the Fitness and Wellness industry, before becoming a Physical Therapist Assistant and deciding that healthcare wasn't for me.<br>
