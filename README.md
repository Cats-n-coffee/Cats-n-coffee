### Hi there, I'm Lucie ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working on challenging projects by collaborating or working on my own. I have a weird obsession with user interfaces and all things visual.<br>
I currently work as a Frontend Developer and solve cool problems that help people, making the world more open every day. 
<br>

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on multiple things: wrapping my head around a basic Vulkan app, learning Three.js and building a blog.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
- C#, .Net framework,
- Three.js and WebGL,
- Browser rendering and browser engines by reading and watching various Chromium and Blink resources
- Devops and random backend things

<br>

My new blog still under construction and still using a great Netlify URL: [here](https://thunderous-entremet-b9494d.netlify.app/)<br>
