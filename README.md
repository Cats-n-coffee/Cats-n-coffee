### Hi there, I'm Lucie ðŸ‘‹

I am a web developer who enjoys working on challenging projects by collaborating or working on my own. <br>
I just finished a batch at the Recurse Center where I worked on various projects, and learned (more than I expected) about some Computer Science topics as well as React, JavaScript, NodeJs and networking. <br>
I am currently volunteering at The Programming Foundation and helping with some frontend tasks for their Learn platform.
<br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [Tree Visualizer Tool](https://github.com/Cats-n-coffee/tree-visualizer), a tool to visualize a React project in the form of  a tree of components.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
- Frontend testing using Jest, React Testing Library and Cypress for E2E.
- Typescript.
- React on a deeper level with the [Epic React Course](https://epicreact.dev/) :rocket:.

âš¡ Fun fact: As a former Fitness/ Personal Trainer I spent years in the Fitness and Wellness industry, before becoming a Physical Therapist Assistant for a (very) short amount of time.<br>
