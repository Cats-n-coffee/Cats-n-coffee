### Hi there, I'm Lucie ðŸ‘‹

I am a web developer who enjoys working on challenging projects, and also relax with simple and short projects or exercises :massage_woman:. <br>
I just finished a batch at the Recurse Center where I worked on various projects, and learned (more than I expected) about some Computer Science topics as well as React, JavaScript, NodeJs and networking. <br>
<br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [LittleNodeBrowser](https://github.com/Cats-n-coffee/littleNodeBrowser), a very simplied version of a web browser.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
- SQL using PostgreSQL.
- Testing using Jest and React Testing Library.
- React on a deeper level with the [Epic React Course](https://epicreact.dev/) :rocket:.

<br>

Checkout [My codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/Cats-n-coffee), where I will now have my small frontend projects and small exercises.<br>

<br>

âš¡ Fun fact: As a former Fitness/ Personal Trainer I spent years in the Fitness and Wellness industry, before becoming a Physical Therapist Assistant for a (very) short amount of time.<br>
